# Advanced HTML Project

## Welcome!

Welcome to the Web Stack specialization. The first 3 projects will give you all the basics of web development: HTML, CSS, and Developer tools.

In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling - don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly.” It’s normal; it’s not the purpose of this project.

**Important note:** Details are important! Be careful with lowercase vs uppercase, wrong letters, etc.
