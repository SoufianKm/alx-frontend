5. **How to use Enzymeâ€™s Shadow rendering to test your application**:
   - Understand what Enzyme is and how to use it for testing React components.
   - Learn how to perform shallow rendering and write unit tests for your components.

6. **How to use React with Webpack & Babel**:
   - Learn how to set up a React project using Webpack and Babel for bundling and transpiling your code.
   - Understand the benefits of using Webpack and Babel in a React project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install create-react-app**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Create a new component**:
   ```javascript
   // src/components/MyComponent.js
   import React from 'react';

   function MyComponent() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

4. **Use the component in your application**:
   ```javascript
   // src/App.js
   import React from 'react';
   import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <MyComponent />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

5. **Install and configure React Developer Tools**:
   - Install the React Developer Tools extension in your browser.
   - Use the tools to inspect and debug your React components.

6. **Install Enzyme for testing**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
   npm install --save-dev enzyme-to-json
   ```

   **Configure Enzyme**:
   ```javascript
   // src/setupTests.js
   import { configure } from 'enzyme';
   import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

   configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
   ```

   **Write a test using Enzyme**:
   ```javascript
   // src/components/MyComponent.test.js
   import React from 'react';
   import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

   it('renders without crashing', () => {
     shallow(<MyComponent />);
   });
   ```
